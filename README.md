wield.pytest
====================

A set of pytest fixtures and helpers used in the python wield packages and their
test suites.

A primary purpose of these fixtures is to enable tests to better store and
side-effects such as plots and outputs. This helps the pytest test suite to be
used and developed more like a Jupyter (or other) notebook.
