wavestate.pytest
------------------

A set of pytest fixtures and helpers used in the wavestate packages and their test suites.

The main purpose of these fixtures is to enable tests to better store and side-effects such as plots and outputs. This helps the pytest test suite to be used and developed more like a Jupyter (or other) notebook.
